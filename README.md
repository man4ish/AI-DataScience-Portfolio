# Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repo showcases a collection of data science and machine learning projects that I’ve built to explore real-world problems, develop end-to-end pipelines, and demonstrate my practical and theoretical skills across various domains including bioinformatics, business analytics, and NLP.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder with:
- **README.md** – Project overview & key insights  
- **Jupyter Notebook / Python Scripts** – Code with step-by-step analysis  
- **Data** – Link to or samples of used datasets  
- **Visuals / Output** – Plots, model evaluations, dashboards (if any)
