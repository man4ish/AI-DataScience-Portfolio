!Series_summary	"Metastatic hormone-naïve prostate cancer (mHNPC) is an infrequent form of this tumour type that is characterized by metastasis at the time of diagnosis and accounts for 50% of prostate cancer-related deaths. Despite the extensive characterization of localized and metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), the molecular characteristics of mHNPC remain largely unexplored. To characterize the transcriptomic landscape of mHNPC, we generated discovery and validation bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. We performed integrative computational analysis in combination with experimental studies. Our results provide unprecedented evidence of the distinctive transcriptional profile of mHNPC and identify stroma remodelling as a predominant feature of these tumours. Importantly, we discover a central role for the transcription factor SOX11 in triggering a heterotypic communication that is associated to the acquisition of metastatic properties. Our study will constitute an invaluable resource for a profound understanding of mHNPC that can influence patient management."
!Series_overall_design	"To characterize transcriptomic alterations emanating from SOX11 overexpression, we generated RNA-Seq in the DU145 cell line upon exogenous SOX11 expression and control cells."
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
