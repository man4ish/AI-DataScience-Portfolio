# Cancer Subtype Prediction using H2O AutoML

This project demonstrates the use of **H2O.ai AutoML** to predict breast cancer subtypes based on transcriptomic gene expression data. Using real-world-like RNA-seq data, the pipeline automatically trains and evaluates multiple machine learning models to identify the best performing model for classifying cancer subtypes.

## Features

- Automated model training and selection using H2O AutoML  
- Supports multiple classification algorithms (GLM, GBM, Deep Learning, etc.)  
- Generates model leaderboard with detailed performance metrics  
- Provides variable importance for feature interpretability  
- Saves the best model for downstream use  
- Easy to integrate with transcriptomics datasets in CSV format

## How to Use

1. Prepare your gene expression dataset in CSV format with samples labeled by cancer subtype.  
2. Use H2Oâ€™s Python API to load data, specify features and target, and split into train/test sets.  
3. Run the AutoML process specifying runtime and model limits.  
4. Evaluate models via leaderboard and select the best model.  
5. Save the best model for future predictions.
